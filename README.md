# Movie-poster-Genre-Prediction
We propose to achieve movie genre classification based only on movie poster images. A deep neural network is constructed to jointly describe visual appearance and object information, and classify a given movie poster image into genres. Because a movie may belong to multiple genres, this is a multi-label image classification problem. To facilitate related studies, we collect a large-scale movie poster dataset, associated with various metadata. 

The dataset was collected from the IMDB website. One poster image was collected from one (mostly) Hollywood movie released from 1980 to 2015. Each poster image is associated with a movie as well as some metadata like ID, genres, and box office. The ID of each image is set as its file name.
