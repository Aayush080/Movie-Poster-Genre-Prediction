# Movie-poster-Genre-Prediction
We propose to achieve movie genre classification based only on movie poster images. A deep neural network is constructed to jointly describe visual appearance and object information, and classify a given movie poster image into genres. Because a movie may belong to multiple genres, this is a multi-label image classification problem. To facilitate related studies, we collect a large-scale movie poster dataset, associated with various metadata. 
# DATASET 
The dataset was collected from the IMDB website. One poster image was collected from one (mostly) Hollywood movie released from 1980 to 2015. Each poster image is associated with a movie as well as some metadata like ID, genres, and box office. The ID of each image is set as its file name.

## Total Poster Images-7254
Total Genres -25
